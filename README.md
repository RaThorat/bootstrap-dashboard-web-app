# bootstrap-dashboard-web-app

This dashboard is an example to design and to style a dashboard app completely in python with Dash Bootstrap. It includes the grid of the page, fonts, colors, rows and columns when designing future dashboard apps.

The dashboard was created with python dash plotly. I used the video from charming data:

The example input data you can find in the github repository. The data used is about grant applications by the companies.The company names are anonimised for obvious reasons. The other data (money, dates) are heavily modified so as not to be able to trace to its origin.

How to use: If you want to see the entire dashboard on your laptop or on your external screen, zoom out 67% in your browser with your laptop or with your screen. You can also view the dashboard on your mobile browser. The graphs are interactive. You can use dropdown or checklist. You can also click or hover over the graphs to see more information. The graphs are examples for further development.
